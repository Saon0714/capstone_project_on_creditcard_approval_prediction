# capstone_project_on_creditcard_approval_prediction

## Project Overview: 
This project aims to predict the likelihood of credit card approval based on various features of the applicant. The project uses a machine learning algorithm to classify whether an application is approved or rejected.

## Data: 
The dataset used in this project contains 1548 instances and 19 attributes. The data was preprocessed by removing missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical, and scaling the features.

## Models: 
We used various classification models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, Naive Bayes . The parameters were tuned using hyperparameter tuning and the performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Results: 
The final model achieved an accuracy of 85%. A confusion matrix and ROC curve were also produced to visualize the model's performance.
